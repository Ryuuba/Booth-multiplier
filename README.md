# Booth multiplier radix 4

This repo contains a C implementation of the Booth multiplier radix 4. It is intended to analize the compilation process of a C code into an RISC-V assembly program.

The operands are 16-bit signed numbers that fit a 32 bit register. In this way, the implementation works fine in an implementation of the the ISA RV32I.
